# modular_fourier_transform
 Fourier transform in positive characteristic. 
 
Abelian case when representations are just maps $\ZZ_n \rightarrow (F_p)^* \cong \ZZ_{p-1}$.

Non-abeliean case requires quite modular representation theory, namely the decomposition of the group algebra kG = \oplus_i B_i into blocks, and dealing with the case $p|n$.
