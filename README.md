# modular_fourier_transform
 Fourier transform in positive characteristic. 
 
 Abelian case when representations are just maps \ZZ_n \rightarrow (F_p)^* \cong \ZZ_{p-1}.

Non-abeliean case requires quite a bit of modular representation theory, namely the decomposition of the group algebra kG = \oplus B_i into blocks.
