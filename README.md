# discrete-fourier-transform-over-finite-field 
 
Implements the discrete Fourier transform for the cyclic group and symmetric group over finite fields and number fields. 

For finite fields, when $p| |G|$ we use the modular DFT, which is given by the Peirce decomposition using central primitive orthogonal idempotents.
