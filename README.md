# modular_fourier_transform
 Fourier transform in positive characteristic. 
 
Abelian case when representations are just maps $\mathbb{Z}_n \rightarrow F_p^* \cong \mathbb{Z}_{p-1}$.

Non-abeliean case requires quite modular representation theory, namely the decomposition of the group algebra $kG = \oplus_i B_i$ into blocks, and dealing with the case $p|n$.
